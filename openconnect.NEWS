openconnect (3.20-2) unstable; urgency=low

  OpenConnect is now configured to use the script provided by the vpnc-scripts
  package by default. If you were downloading this script as suggested by the
  OpenConnect documentation, you can now use it as shipped in Debian without
  any custom configuration.
